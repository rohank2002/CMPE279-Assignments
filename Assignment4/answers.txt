1.What happens if the file being requested is not inside the chroot? Does it matter?

It does not matter if the file is not in the chroot directory, the file descriptor is passed to child from the parent.

2.Explain the mechanism you are using to pass file descriptors between parent and child processes.

File descriptor is created using fnctl.h in parent which is passed to child. The child process gets it through argument.

3.What happens if the file size of the disk file exceeds the size of the clientâ€™s hardcoded buffer? Does the client have sufficient checks to ensure no buffer overruns occur?

 The client has a provision to ensure no buffer overflow attack can be exploited. The valread = read( sock , buffer, 1024); 1024 is the limit. It will only read the content of the file by as per its capacity, no error will be display.
